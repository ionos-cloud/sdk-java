# IONOS Cloud SDK

CLOUD API
- API version: 5.0
  - Build date: 2021-03-04T15:35:45.982Z[Etc/UTC]

An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. 

The API allows you to perform a variety of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes, adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.


## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.7+
2. Maven/Gradle

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.
