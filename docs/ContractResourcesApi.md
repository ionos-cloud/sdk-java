import com.ionoscloud.ApiClient;
import com.ionoscloud.ApiException;
import com.ionoscloud.Configuration;
import com.ionoscloud.auth.*;
import com.ionoscloud.model.*;
import com.ionoscloud.api.ContractResourcesApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    
    // Configure HTTP basic authorization: Basic Authentication
    HttpBasicAuth basicAuthentication = (HttpBasicAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("Basic Authentication");
    basicAuthentication.setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
    basicAuthentication.setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");


    ContractResourcesApi apiInstance = new ContractResourcesApi(defaultClient);
    Boolean pretty = true; // Boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines)
    Integer depth = 0; // Integer | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children's children are included  - depth=... and so on
    Integer xContractNumber = 56; // Integer | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed
    try {
      Contracts result = apiInstance.contractsGet(pretty, depth, xContractNumber);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
